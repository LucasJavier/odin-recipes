        <h1>Soft, fluffy bread or milk rolls</h1>
        <img src="../img/buns.JPG" alt="Finished buns">
        <p>Milk bread, milk rolls, half nights or Vienna bread, is ideal for 
        preparing mid-morning snacks or breakfasts for children. It has all the 
        properties of bread but is also enriched with milk, which makes it very 
        tender and fluffy with a sweet point that you will like very much.
        </p>
        <p>These types of recipes of scones, usually have a common denominator. 
        It is a brioche type dough similar to Christian or milk rolls, the 
        recipes that most reminds me of my childhood. They can be filled with
        both sweet and salty and are great if we open them in two, we pass them
        through the toaster and then spread with butter, especially if they are 
        made of the day before and already begin to harden a little.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>330 g. of wheat flour with strength W220, flour 000 or wheat 
            flour with 11,5 - 12,5 % protein
            </li>
            <li>9 g. of fresh baked yeast or 3 g. of freeze-dried baker's yeast</li>
            <li>125 ml. of whole milk</li>
            <li>25 g. butter (ointment texture)</li>
            <li>50 g. of sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>spoon of essence of vanilla</li>
            <li>spoon of fine salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Preparation of milk bread dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl add the milk, sugar, vanilla essence, salt and egg.
                Whisk together. Add the butter (the butter must be melted and
                warm) and continue beating until it is integrated with the other
                ingredients. The butter can be replaced with extra soft virgin 
                olive oil although in less proportion, in this case 20 ml. of
                oil.
            </li>
            <li>We add the flour gradually as we integrate it with the liquids. 
                We also add the yeast. First with the help of a fork and then 
                with the hands we integrate the ingredients. We knead until we
                get a homogeneous dough ball. It is not necessary to work the
                dough long, it is a question of homogenizing all the ingredients.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Rest, shape and baking of milk bread</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We leave the dough in the same mixing bowl and cover it with 
            transparent film. Ferment the dough in a warm place for not less 
            than 2 hours, until its volume has doubled.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the fermented dough over a floured surface and work it for a
            few seconds to degrease it. We make 12-13 portions of dough. Each of 
            the portions will have about 40 grams. We form the portions and place in
            the baking dish on a vegetable paper. Let it rest a second time, in a
            warm place, for another 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>We paint the breads with milk while preheating the oven to 180ยบ C.</li>
            <li>Bake the breads at 180ยบ C, with heat above and below, without the 
            fan option, for 18-20 minutes. Once baked, remove them from the oven
            and let them cool completely on a rack.
            </li>
            <li>Some rolls that look super good, very tender, with good crumbs
            and very rich flavor. Ideal to fill with your favorite ingredients,
            sweet or salty.
            </li>
        </ol>
