        <h1> Lasagna </h1>
        <img src = "../img/lasagna.jpg" alt = "Finished lasagna">
        <p>This classic cuisine is famous all over the world, not only in Italy. 
            Ideal to wear on the carpet to work or school, and it certainly 
            triumphs among the little ones at home. Do not overdo the amount, 
            with a portion is enough, a fairly complete recipe and gives you to 
            overcome a day full of energy.a
        </p>
        <p> What I always recommend is to use quality ingredients, from pasta, in
            this case lasagna Garofalo, one of the best pasta in Italy. And of
            course, the fillings, today meat, but you have many ways to fill it.
            Following the recipe you can make lasagna with vegetables, the 
            classic lasagna with tuna or lasagna with fish, which is a great 
            option, tuna, hake, even combine it with seafood.

        </ul>

            <li>125 g of all-purpose wheat flour</li>
            <li>125 g of butter</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Preparation of the meat lasagna</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pot of water, the widest at home. When it begins to
                boil, we pour 2 generous handfuls of salt.</li>
            <li>We introduce the lasagna sheets one by one without touching them
                (so that they do not stick together). Now we can find countless 
                types of lasagna where it does not hydrate as it was done before. 
                At home many times to save time I use those that are hydrated with
                the bechamel and the juice that drops the sauce when baking.</li>
            <li>If you do it in the traditional way we have to stir with a wooden
                spoon and in about 10 minutes we remove the sheets. We stretch 
                them on top of some sheets of absorbent kitchen paper. Even if 
                you think they are not, they will end up in the oven.</li>
            <li>The next step will be to wash very well all the vegetables that
                we will use in the filling. In the recipe I recommend the stuffing
                of the classic bolognese sauce, carrots, garlic, peppers and 
                onion.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to make meat lasagna filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the vegetables into small pieces so that they are well 
            combined in the sauce. The carrots are cut as thin as possible. I
            recommend to laminate them with the peeler of the potatoes because at 
            the time of pocharlas if the strips are thick they are not made. We 
            reserve everything in a bowl.</li>
            <li>In another casserole we pour extra virgin olive oil. Start by 
            poaching the onion and garlic, when golden, add the rest of the
            ingredients.</li>
            <li>We fry everything at average temperature within about 15 minutes 
            and we wait for meat. We pepper meat to taste and we stack it on a 
            casserole with greens. Let it pass for 5 minutes and when we see it 
            changing color introduce bacon or bacon in very small pieces. Pour a 
            glass of white wine and wait for it to reduce (another 5 minutes on
            medium heat).</li>
            <li>Add a glass of natural tomato, pour the teaspoon of oregano and 
            rectify salt and pepper if necessary (try the salsa to see if it is
            to your liking). Stir the meat with the vegetables and remove from
            the heat, let cool a little.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC for 15 minutes, just enough to make the 
            rest of the lasagna.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Preparation of the bechamel sauce and end of the recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>While the sauce rests we are going to prepare the bechamel, we 
            can prepare it creamier or more consistent depending on the measures. 
            In the blog you have the recipe of this cream with all the details.</li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna the thing is very simple. We put at the 
            bottom of the fountain a few tablespoons of the béchamel. Top the
            sheets, a layer of the mixture with the meat in each sheet, again the
            béchamel sauce and so on until 3 floors.</li>
            <li>You can make as many layers of lasagna as you want, as the source 
            allows. Finally, we finish with a generous layer of béchamel sauce. 
            And for those who like cheese, let's grate the one you like, which is
            special for grating. I recommend a Grana Padano curadito cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake on the middle tray for 15 minutes at 180º C and for 3-5 
            minutes on top with the gratin put so that it browns. Ready to eat, 
            no need for rest, from oven to table.</li>
            <li>This recipe besides being economical is a healthy recipe, full of 
            proteins and carbohydrates. I always present it as a unique dish, I 
            hope you like it.</li>
